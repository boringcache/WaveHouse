Everything you need to build, test, lint, and contribute to WaveHouse — from first-clone to hot-reload dev server to full end-to-end SDK tests. If you're only trying the product, start with the [Getting Started](/getting-started) guide instead.

## Prerequisites

You need these on your `PATH` before any `make` recipe will work end-to-end:

| Tool | Required version | Why | Install |
| ---- | ---------------- | --- | ------- |
| **Go** | 1.26+ (matches `go.mod`) | Compiles `cmd/wavehouse`; also runs the pinned `tool` deps (`gotestsum`, `gofumpt`, `goimports`, `govulncheck`, `deadcode`, `gsa`, `goda`) via `go tool` | [go.dev/dl](https://go.dev/dl/) |
| **GNU Make** | **4.0+** | The Makefile uses `--output-sync=target` (Make 4 only) and bash-pinned recipes. macOS ships with BSD Make 3.81, which **will not work** | macOS: `brew install make` then use `gmake` or put `$(brew --prefix make)/libexec/gnubin` on your PATH. Linux: usually already installed |
| **bash** | 4+ recommended | Recipes are pinned to `bash`; the helper scripts under `scripts/` use `set -euo pipefail` and bash arrays | macOS default is bash 3.2 (works for current recipes, but `brew install bash` is safer); Linux distros ship 4+ |
| **Docker** *(or Podman)* | Engine 20.10+ with the Compose **v2** plugin (`docker compose`, no hyphen) | Compose stacks under `deployments/compose/`; the E2E and integration suites boot ClickHouse via testcontainers (no compose file) | [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), [colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima), or [Podman](https://podman.io) with `podman-compose` / the `podman compose` plugin. The testcontainers Go library also honors `DOCKER_HOST` for rootless Podman setups |
| **Node.js** | 22 LTS — pinned via `.nvmrc` at the repo root | Runtime for pnpm and the Vitest suites. Pinned to match CI (`setup-node` uses 22) and to avoid Node-major surprises; older Vitest versions in this repo were known to crash on Node 26 with a V8 heap-allocation abort | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) or `nvm use` / `fnm use` / `volta` (all read `.nvmrc`) |
| **pnpm** | 11.21+ (pinned via `packageManager` in the root `package.json`) | Package manager for the TypeScript SDK, E2E test harness, and docs site (managed as a single pnpm workspace from the repo root); `make build-ts`, `make test-ts`, `make test-e2e`, `make build-docs`, `make dev-docs`, `make preview-docs` all shell out to `pnpm` | `corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@11.21.0 --activate` (recommended), or `npm i -g pnpm` |
| **git** + **curl** | any recent | `git` for source + version metadata in builds; `curl` is used by the Makefile to fetch the pinned `golangci-lint` binary into `.bin/` | usually preinstalled |

### Auto-installed by `make tools`

Run `make tools` once after cloning to populate everything that doesn't have to be on your PATH:

- **`golangci-lint` v2.11.4** → installed to `.bin/<os>_<arch>/` (version-pinned in the Makefile; bumping the version triggers a reinstall). Not in `go.mod` because its dependency tree conflicts with the main module.
- **`misspell` v0.8.0, `shellcheck` v0.11.0, `actionlint` v1.7.12** → installed to `.bin/<os>_<arch>/`; they back `make lint-prose`, `make lint-sh`, and `make lint-gha`. `make tools` also points `core.hooksPath` at `.githooks/`, which is what installs the pre-commit and pre-push gates.
- **`air` v1.65.1** → installed to `.bin/<os>_<arch>/` via `go install`; used by `make dev` for hot-reload. Same exclusion principle as `golangci-lint` — air's transitive deps (Hugo, Sass libs) would bloat `go.sum`.
- **Go `tool` deps** (`gotestsum`, `gofumpt`, `goimports`, `govulncheck`, `go-test-coverage`, `gocover-cobertura`, `deadcode`, `gsa`, `goda`) — pinned in `go.mod` via native `tool` directives (Go 1.24+), invoked with `go tool <name>`. `make tools` runs `go mod download` so they're cached; they compile lazily on first invocation.
- **pnpm deps** for the repo root plus `clients/ts/`, `tests/e2e/sdk/`, and `docs/` (via `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`). The root workspace is where the repo-wide linters live — **Biome** (JS/TS/JSON) and **markdownlint-cli2** (Markdown/MDX, including the repo-local `WH001`/`WH002` rules). Neither is ever run from a global install: `make lint` / `make fix` shell out to `pnpm -w run`, and every target that needs them declares the `pnpm-install` prerequisite, so a clean clone is linting correctly after `make tools` with nothing else on your PATH. `make tools` runs only the pnpm install; the Playwright Chromium binary (~130 MB) is fetched on-demand by `make build-docs` / `make dev-docs` via the internal `install-playwright-docs` target, so Go-only contributors don't pay the download cost. When you do hit `build-docs` / `dev-docs`, Chromium is required by two parts of the docs *build*: `rehype-mermaid` (SVG diagram rendering) and the `diagram-png` integration (`docs/src/integrations/diagram-png.mjs`), which rasterizes each diagram to light/dark PNGs (a solid surface-card variant plus a transparent-background variant for slide decks) at `astro:build:done` for the Copy/Download buttons in the zoom lightbox. Both reuse the same Playwright Chromium, as does the manual `docs/scripts/screenshot.mjs` QA helper. `starlight-links-validator` runs under `build-docs` / CI only — the `dev-docs` watch loop skips it so a mid-edit dangling link doesn't fail every rebuild (CI still enforces link validity before merge; run `DOCS_WATCH_STRICT=1 make dev-docs` to keep the validator on locally). The `--with-deps` flag (which apt-installs Chromium's system libraries: `libnspr4`, `libnss3`, etc.) is only added when `$CI` is set, so contributor laptops don't get an unexpected `sudo` prompt. On Linux dev machines without those libs already present, run `pnpm exec playwright install-deps chromium` once manually. The docs site is a pnpm workspace package (`wavehouse-docs`); the root Makefile drives it directly via `pnpm --filter` (no sub-Makefile) — the `*-docs` targets show up in `make help`. It is also a real `@wavehouse/sdk` consumer (the landing page's live demo imports the workspace package), so `check-docs` / `build-docs` / `dev-docs` build the SDK first via `build-ts`; if you drive Astro directly through pnpm (e.g. `pnpm --filter wavehouse-docs run start`), run `make build-ts` once first so the dep resolves.

### Verify your setup

```bash
go version          # go1.26+
make --version      # GNU Make 4.x
docker compose version
node --version      # v22.x (matches .nvmrc and CI)
pnpm --version      # 11.21+
```

If any of those are wrong/missing, the Makefile recipes will fail with confusing errors (e.g. `--output-sync` is unrecognized on Make 3.81; `pnpm: command not found` on `make test-ts`).

### Optional but recommended

| Tool | Why | Install |
| ---- | --- | ------- |
| **[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)** | The repo ships team-wide configuration in `.claude/` — slash commands, subagents, hooks, status line. See [Claude Code & AI agents](/claude-code) for setup. | `brew install --cask claude-code` (macOS) or follow [official install](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/quickstart) |
| **[worktrunk](https://worktrunk.dev)** | Wraps `git worktree` for parallel-agent workflows. Project hooks live in `.config/wt.toml` (auto-runs `make tools` on new worktrees, `make verify` on pre-merge). | `brew install worktrunk && wt config shell install` |

## Quick Start

This is the fastest way to get a fully functional local environment:

```bash
# 1. Clone and bootstrap (Go modules + golangci-lint + pnpm deps)
git clone https://github.com/Wave-RF/WaveHouse.git
cd WaveHouse
make tools

# 2. Start ClickHouse (the only external dependency)
docker compose -f deployments/compose/dependencies.yaml up -d clickhouse

# 3. Create a table in ClickHouse
docker compose -f deployments/compose/dependencies.yaml exec clickhouse \
  clickhouse-client --query "
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS clicks (
      page String,
      button String,
      score Float64,
      received_timestamp DateTime64(3, 'UTC') DEFAULT now64(3, 'UTC')
    ) ENGINE = MergeTree()
    ORDER BY (page)
  "

# 4. Run with hot-reload (recompiles on every .go file save)
make dev
```

WaveHouse is now running at `http://localhost:8080` in standalone mode with:

- **Embedded NATS** (JetStream) — no external MQ needed
- **L1 cache only** (Ristretto) — no external cache needed
- **Trial policy** — the dev settings directory `./settings` is seeded on first run with the compose stack's permissive `public` policy, so tokenless requests to the demo tables work (see [Test the API](#test-the-api))
- **Dedup disabled** by default — no Pebble needed
- **Schema discovery** — automatically finds your ClickHouse tables

### Test the API

On first run `make dev` seeds the gitignored `./settings` directory with `wavehouse bootstrap` and copies in the compose stack's trial policy (`deployments/compose/settings/policies.json` + `roles.json` — the `public` role: read/write `clicks`/`events`, no token). WaveHouse is otherwise fail-closed (the bootstrap seed ships no policy), so a `./settings` you emptied by hand denies every request until you put a policy back. Edits to any file in `./settings` hot-reload without a restart.

The tokenless data-plane calls work (create a `clicks` table first — see the [Getting Started](/getting-started) walkthrough):

```bash
# Ingest an event
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8080/v1/ingest?table=clicks" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"page": "/home", "button": "signup", "score": 42.5}'
# → {"ok":true}

# Query it back (wait ~5s for the batch flush)
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8080/v1/query?table=clicks" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"columns": ["page", "button", "score"], "limit": 10}'

# Open an SSE stream for a specific table (Ctrl+C to stop)
curl -N "http://localhost:8080/v1/stream?table=clicks"

# With gap-fill (replays events since the given timestamp, then switches to live)
curl -N "http://localhost:8080/v1/stream?table=clicks&since=2026-03-24T11:00:00Z"

# Liveness / readiness (no auth required)
curl http://localhost:8080/livez   # → {"status":"ok"}
curl http://localhost:8080/readyz  # → {"status":"ready"}
```

The admin surface — `/v1/ops/schema`, `/v1/ops/query` (raw SQL), `/v1/ops/dlq/stats` — needs the **admin** role, which the `public` trial role doesn't have. Mint an admin JWT (see [Validating tokens](#validating-tokens) below) and pass it:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080/v1/ops/schema -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/ops/query -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"sql": "SELECT * FROM clicks LIMIT 10"}'
curl -s http://localhost:8080/v1/ops/dlq/stats -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### How `make dev` works

`make dev` is a one-stop convenience target for backend and frontend development. The recipe is essentially:

```make
dev: deps-up $(AIR)
    air -c .air.toml
```

`deps-up` runs `docker compose ... up -d --wait clickhouse`, which blocks until the ClickHouse container's `/ping` healthcheck flips to healthy. `$(AIR)` lazily installs air to `.bin/<os>_<arch>/` if missing. Then air takes over: it watches `cmd/` and `internal/` (the `.go` and `.yaml` files within them), rebuilds `tmp/wavehouse` on change, and restarts the binary. Boot config is **not** hot-reloaded (the settings directory it points at is — see [Enable Dedup](#enable-dedup-optional)): `make dev` runs the binary with `WH_CONFIG=.config.local.yaml` — a gitignored personal copy seeded **once** from `config.yaml` on first run (it won't re-copy if it already exists). So to change dev config, edit `.config.local.yaml` (not `config.yaml`) and restart `make dev`; air watches neither root file. The flip side: when `config.yaml` gains a key your copy lacks, your copy is stale — `make dev` warns when `config.yaml` is newer than `.config.local.yaml`, and the fix is to port the change over or delete `.config.local.yaml` to re-seed it. `settings.dir` is the one key that will stop the server outright if it's missing (it's required with no default), so a checkout whose local copy predates it fails at config validation until re-seeded.

`air` is pinned to a specific version and installed via `go install` rather than a `go.mod` tool directive — its transitive deps (Hugo, godartsass, Sass libs) would bloat `go.sum` for everyone. Same exclusion principle as `golangci-lint`.

**While `make dev` is running you get:**

- WaveHouse on `http://localhost:8080` with the default allow-all CORS posture, so a browser-based app on any localhost port can hit the API directly.
- A placeholder JWT secret (`change-me-in-production`) ships in `config.yaml`, and the trial `public` policy in `./settings` (see [Test the API](#test-the-api)). Override the secret via `WH_AUTH_JWT_SECRET`.
- ClickHouse on `http://localhost:8123` (HTTP) and `localhost:9000` (native protocol), Compose project name `wavehouse-dev` so containers/volumes are namespaced.
- Hot reload: editing any `.go` file under `cmd/` or `internal/` triggers a debounced rebuild + restart. Boot config isn't hot-reloaded (settings-directory files are) — `make dev` loads `.config.local.yaml` (a gitignored copy seeded once from `config.yaml`), so edit `.config.local.yaml` and restart to apply config changes. Air's stdout/stderr stream live so you see compile errors and server logs in the same terminal.

### Dev convenience targets

These are the small targets behind `make dev` — useful directly when you want to run WaveHouse outside of air (e.g. `make settings/config.json && make build && ./bin/wavehouse`), or when you need to poke at ClickHouse:

| Target | What it does |
| ------ | ------------ |
| `make deps-up` | Start ClickHouse and block until healthy. Idempotent. |
| `make deps-down` | Stop ClickHouse. Data volume is preserved. |
| `make deps-logs` | `docker compose logs -f clickhouse` (Ctrl+C detaches; container keeps running). |
| `make deps-shell` | Drop into a `clickhouse-client` REPL on the running container. |
| `make deps-wipe` | Stop ClickHouse **and destroy its data volume**. Use when you want a clean schema. |
| `make clean-all` | Nuclear option — every `make` artifact + dev/E2E containers + volumes + `data/`. |

**Stopping `make dev`**: `Ctrl+C` stops air, which propagates SIGINT to WaveHouse for a graceful shutdown (NATS JetStream flush, etc.). ClickHouse stays up — re-running `make dev` is fast because the volume is preserved. Use `make deps-down` or `make deps-wipe` to stop ClickHouse explicitly.

### Running with observability

WaveHouse natively exports standard OpenTelemetry (OTLP) data to `127.0.0.1:4317`. Rather than coupling a heavy observability database stack to the dev server, we provide three lightweight, single-container dashboard options.

You run these in a separate terminal tab alongside `make dev` or your test suites (`make test-e2e`).

They block the terminal and stream logs; simply press `Ctrl+C` to instantly tear them down and clean up the container.

| Target | What it does | UI URL |
| ------ | ------------ | ------ |
| `make obs-aspire` | Boots the Aspire dashboard. Extremely fast, in-memory only, and requires no login. Ideal for quick trace and log debugging. | `http://localhost:18888` |
| `make obs-grafana` | Boots Grafana LGTM (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, Prometheus). Pre-configured to bypass login. Best for advanced UI charting and trace-to-log correlation. | `http://localhost:3000` |
| `make obs-front` | Boots OTel-Front for a basic, alternative trace viewer. | `http://localhost:8000` |

**Typical Workflow:**

1. Open Tab 1: run `make obs-aspire` (UI opens automatically)
2. Open Tab 2: run `make dev` (or `make test-e2e`)
3. View traces, metrics, and logs flowing into the UI instantly. No accounts or auth tokens required.

### Using the SDK against `make dev`

There's no bundled playground — point the published `@wavehouse/sdk` client at your local server (`baseURL: "http://localhost:8080"`); the trial policy `make dev` seeds into `./settings` authorizes the demo-table requests:

```bash
make dev
```

See the [SDK guide](/sdk) for the client API and examples.

Frontend devs running their own dev server (Vite, Next.js, etc.) can `import { createClient } from '@wavehouse/sdk'` and point `baseURL: 'http://localhost:8080'`; CORS is permissive so cross-origin browser requests just work.

### Validating tokens

There is no auth on/off switch — the JWT middleware always runs, but authorization is the policy's job (an empty `policies.json` adopts no policy and denies every token-based caller, admins included — only the operator key below still reaches the admin surface). To exercise token auth in dev, set a known secret — the trial policy's `admin_role` defaults to `admin`, so a JWT with `role: admin` unlocks the admin surface:

```bash
WH_AUTH_JWT_SECRET=my-secret make dev
```

The **operator key** is a non-JWT alternative: set one and send it in an `Authorization: Operator <key>` header (or the `X-Operator-Key` alias). Even with no policy adopted it reaches the **admin surface** — enough to trigger a settings reload over HTTP after fixing `policies.json` (the break-glass path). Once a policy is adopted, the key's role resolves to `admin`, so it then has full data-plane access too (pipes, queries, streaming, ingest) — handy for trialing without minting a JWT:

```bash
WH_AUTH_OPERATOR_KEY=dev-operator-key make dev
# ...then, in another shell — the admin surface works even with no policy adopted:
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Operator dev-operator-key" http://localhost:8080/v1/ops/settings/reload
# the X-Operator-Key alias works too:
curl -H "X-Operator-Key: dev-operator-key" http://localhost:8080/v1/ops/pipes
```

Then mint a token (role == the policy `admin_role`) and call an admin endpoint:

```bash
# Using jwt-cli (https://github.com/mike-engel/jwt-cli)
export TOKEN=$(jwt encode --secret "my-secret" '{"role": "admin", "exp": 9999999999}')

curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/ops/query \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sql": "SELECT * FROM clicks LIMIT 10"}'
```

### Enable Dedup (Optional)

`make dev` seeds `./settings` (gitignored) from the embedded seed on first run and points `settings.dir` at it; the seed ships with `dedupe.enabled: false`. Flip it there — never in the checked-in `internal/settings/seed`, which is what `wavehouse bootstrap` writes for everyone:

```bash
# ./settings already exists after the first `make dev` (or: make settings/config.json)
# set "enabled": true under "dedupe" in ./settings/config.json
```

The key hot-reloads, so once the server is running you can toggle it by editing `config.json` — no restart. Records dedupe on their `event_id` field by default; the same file overrides the field globally or per table (see [Settings Directory — Deduplication](/settings-directory#deduplication)).

Then include the dedup field in your ingest body:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8080/v1/ingest?table=clicks" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001", "page": "/home"}'
# → {"ok":true}

# Same event_id again → deduplicated
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8080/v1/ingest?table=clicks" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001", "page": "/home"}'
# → {"duplicate":true}
```

### Using an .env File

```bash
# .env — boot config only (secrets, sizing, exporters); the ClickHouse
# address and the rest of the wiring are settings-directory keys
export WH_CH_PASSWORD=
```

Then:

```bash
source .env
make settings/config.json   # seeds the gitignored ./settings that config.yaml points at (no-op if it exists)
go run ./cmd/wavehouse
```

## Building

```bash
# Build the binary to bin/
make build

# Build individual binaries
go build -o bin/wavehouse ./cmd/wavehouse
```

## Running Modes at a Glance

| What you want | Command |
| ------------- | ------- |
| Hot-reload standalone dev server | `make dev` |
| Standalone binary (default config) | `make settings/config.json && make build && ./bin/wavehouse` |
| Standalone via Docker Compose | `docker compose -f deployments/compose/standalone.yaml up -d` |
| Infrastructure deps only (ClickHouse) | `docker compose -f deployments/compose/dependencies.yaml up -d clickhouse` |

## Testing

### How It Works

All **Go** test commands use [gotestsum](https://github.com/gotestyourself/gotestsum) for pytest-style colored output with pass/fail icons, durations, and a summary. Tool versions are pinned in `go.mod` via `tool` directives — the Makefile invokes them as `go tool <name>`, so no global installation is needed.

All tests run with Go's **race detector** (`-race`) enabled by default. WaveHouse is highly concurrent (NATS consumers, singleflight caching, SSE hubs) — the race detector catches data races that would panic in production.

### Quick Reference

```bash
# Prefix any test target with V=1 for verbose output, e.g. `V=1 make test`

# Unit tests (compact output) — alias for `test-unit`
make test

# Run specific test(s)
make test ARGS="-run TestValidate"

# Go integration tests (requires Docker)
make test-integration

# SDK vitest unit tests + coverage + gate against suites.ts-unit
# (`make cov` auto-merges ts-unit + ts-e2e — no separate command)
make test-ts

# E2E SDK suite against bin/wavehouse-cov
make test-e2e

# All four suites sequentially + merged coverage
make test-all

# Full CI: parallel verify + builds (Go + SDK + docs) + test + test-ts,
# then test-integration + test-e2e + cov
make ci

# Merge available covdata + gate against total threshold
make cov
```

Each test target writes `covdata` to `tmp/coverage/<suite>/data/`, renders a textfmt + HTML report, and gates against the per-suite threshold in `.testcoverage.yml`. `make cov` merges whichever suites have run and gates against the total.

**Verbose output**: Use `V=1` to switch from compact `testdox` format to full verbose output. This is a standard Makefile convention (`make test -v` can't work because `-v` is a `make` flag).

**Extra flags**: All test targets accept `ARGS="..."` for additional `go test` flags (e.g., `-run`, `-count`, `-timeout`).

**Note on timing**: gotestsum's `DONE ... in X.XXXs` reports pure test execution time. The total wall time includes Go compiling all packages — the first run compiles everything (~15s), subsequent runs use the build cache (~1s).

### Test Structure

| Category | Location | Docker? | Command |
| -------- | -------- | ------- | ------- |
| Unit tests | `internal/*/_test.go` | No | `make test` |
| SDK unit tests | `clients/ts/src/**/*.test.ts` | No | `make test-ts` (always includes coverage + gate) |
| Integration tests (Go) | `tests/integration/*_test.go` | Yes | `make test-integration` |
| E2E tests (SDK) | `tests/e2e/sdk/*.test.ts` | Yes | `make test-e2e` |

- **Unit tests** live beside the code they test (e.g., `internal/discovery/discovery_test.go`). They use mocks or embedded NATS (in-process, no Docker needed).
- **Integration tests** use the `//go:build integration` build tag. The `setupTestEnv` helper starts a ClickHouse testcontainer, embedded NATS, ingest worker, and a full API router via `httptest.Server`. DLQ tests use `assert.Eventually` with a 30-second timeout for the 5-second ingest worker batch window.

Shared test utilities live in `internal/testutil/` (e.g., `testutil.NopLogger()` for silencing embedded NATS output).

### Adding New Tests

- **Unit test for `internal/foo/`** → create `internal/foo/foo_test.go` (same package).
- **Integration test needing Docker** → add a subtest under `tests/integration/` (e.g. a new file with `//go:build integration`).
- **E2E test via SDK** → add a `tests/e2e/sdk/*.test.ts` file. These tests exercise the full pipeline (ingest → ClickHouse → query) through the TypeScript SDK. Run with `make test-e2e`.
- **Test helpers** → add to `internal/testutil/` (Go) or `tests/e2e/sdk/helpers.ts` (E2E).

### E2E Tests via SDK

The primary E2E integration test suite lives in `tests/e2e/sdk/`. It uses the TypeScript SDK as the test harness — every ingest→query test simultaneously validates the full Go backend pipeline and confirms SDK compatibility.

**Architecture**:

- `scripts/orchestrator` — the E2E entrypoint behind `make test-e2e`: it starts a clean ClickHouse **testcontainer** per run, launches the `wavehouse-cov` binary on a random free port, runs the SDK suite against it, then SIGINTs the binary to flush coverage. No Compose file is involved. CI runs the exact same path.
- `tests/e2e/sdk/setup.ts` — `globalSetup`. Probes the `CLICKHOUSE_URL` / `WAVEHOUSE_URL` the orchestrator injects, creates the per-suite tables, refreshes the schema, and writes the baseline policy into the run's settings directory (adopted via `POST /v1/ops/settings/reload` — files are the only write path). It starts nothing itself and fails fast if either URL isn't up. It also prints the active Node/undici version, warning when the local Node major differs from `.nvmrc` — a runtime-specific transport bug is otherwise indistinguishable from a code failure (see [#440](https://github.com/Wave-RF/WaveHouse/issues/440)).
- `tests/e2e/sdk/helpers.ts` — JWT factories, typed client constructors, async wait helpers, direct ClickHouse query helper.

**Running E2E tests**:

```bash
# Build the cover binary, install deps, run all E2E tests
make test-e2e
```

`make test-e2e` builds `bin/wavehouse-cov` (coverage-instrumented) and runs the orchestrator under `scripts/orchestrator/` to wire ClickHouse + the cover binary into the suite. covdata flushes on SIGINT into `tmp/coverage/e2e/data/`.

The orchestrator always provisions its own stack — a fresh ClickHouse testcontainer plus `wavehouse-cov` on a random free port — so a running `make dev` on `:8080` is neither detected nor reused, and the two don't collide. To run vitest against a stack you manage yourself, start the server from the **repo root** with the E2E fixture config:

```bash
WH_CONFIG=tests/e2e/fixtures/config.yaml go run ./cmd/wavehouse
```

The fixture matters: the suite signs its tokens with its `sdk-dev-secret` and depends on its dedupe, DLQ, and 5s schema-refresh settings. Point the suite at a default `make dev` server (`jwt_secret: change-me-in-production`) and setup's schema calls are rejected, then global setup dies 30s later on a misleading `schema not refreshed within 30s`. The repo root matters too — the fixture's `settings.dir` is relative to the working directory. The fixture's settings directory (policy, pipes, and tunables) points at ClickHouse on `localhost:9000`; if yours isn't there, edit `clickhouse.addr` / `http_port` in `tests/e2e/fixtures/settings/config.json` (the orchestrator patches them itself for its testcontainer).

Prefixing the variable to `make dev` does **not** work: that recipe pins `WH_CONFIG=.config.local.yaml` inline, which overrides anything inherited from the environment.

Then set `CLICKHOUSE_URL` / `WAVEHOUSE_URL` and run `pnpm test` from `tests/e2e/sdk/`; teardown is a no-op on that path, so your stack survives between iterations.

If a previous run was killed (harness timeout, stop button, `SIGKILL`), it can leave a `wavehouse-cov` behind. That process shares `tmp/data` and `tmp/wavehouse-cov.log` with the next run and will corrupt it, so the orchestrator kills any leftover before starting and says so.

**Environment knobs**:

| Variable | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `V=1` | Stream the WaveHouse subprocess log live *in addition to* capturing it to `tmp/wavehouse-cov.log`. The on-failure log excerpt is then skipped — you have already seen it |
| `E2E_CH_QUERY_TIMEOUT_MS` | Per-request ceiling for the suite's direct ClickHouse queries (default `10000`) |
| `E2E_NO_COVERAGE=1` | Drop `--coverage` from the vitest run (skips v8 instrumentation and report generation) while chasing a flake. **Local debugging only** — no report is written. Ignored (with a log line) under `make ci` / `make test-all`, so an exported-and-forgotten var can't produce a green coverage gate with the TS e2e report missing |

**Test files** (`tests/e2e/sdk/*.test.ts`): `admin`, `auth`, `batching`, `cache`, `dlq`, `ingest`, `ndjson`, `query`, `streaming`, `stress`, plus `helpers` — a stack-free unit test of the harness's own `waitForCondition` poll helper rather than a pipeline test.

## Linting

```bash
make lint
```

`golangci-lint` is kept out of `go.mod` (its dependency tree conflicts with the main module), so the Makefile pins the version instead and downloads it into `.bin/` on first use — `make lint` and `make tools` both handle it, and no global install is needed.

A global copy is never what `make lint` runs, so install one only if you want to invoke `golangci-lint` outside `make`:

- **macOS**: `brew install golangci-lint`
- **Binary**: See [golangci-lint.run/welcome/install/](https://golangci-lint.run/welcome/install/)

The configuration is in `.golangci.yml` (v2 format with `default: none` for explicit control) — that file is the authoritative list of enabled linters. Highlights:

- **errcheck** — Unchecked error returns
- **govet** — Suspicious constructs
- **staticcheck** — Static analysis
- **unused** — Unused code
- **gosec** — Security issues
- **gocritic** — Opinionated style checks
- **revive** — Extensible linter (replaces golint)
- **ineffassign** — Ineffective assignments
- **misspell** — Spelling errors in comments/strings
- **bodyclose** — Unclosed HTTP response bodies
- **noctx** — HTTP requests without context
- **errorlint** — Proper error wrapping checks (`%w`, `errors.Is/As`)
- **tparallel** — Missing `t.Parallel()` in test subtests

Formatting (**gofumpt** — strict superset of gofmt — and **goimports** import grouping) is enforced through the v2 `formatters:` section rather than as linters.

### Markdown and MDX

`make lint` also covers documentation: **markdownlint** owns Markdown *and* MDX style (rules in `.markdownlint.json`; file selection in `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc` for `.md`, plus the `**/*.mdx` glob on `lint:md` in `package.json`) and **misspell** owns spelling. Two rules are repo-local, in `scripts/markdownlint-rules/`:

- **WH001 / no-hard-wrapped-prose** — a paragraph must be one line. Hard-wrapping at 72/80 columns turns a one-word edit into a five-line diff. Autofixes. Tables (leading pipes optional), code, headings, setext underlines, blockquotes, JSX, `$$` display math, and multi-line MDX `import`/`export` are left alone; a list item is joined as a unit; an aside's body is joined but its `:::` delimiters are not. Note the four-space rule cuts both ways: any line indented four or more spaces is read as an indented code block and skipped, so a *nested* list item is never joined and must be unwrapped by hand.
- **WH002 / mdx-fence-needs-blank-line** — an MDX code fence directly against a JSX tag (`<TabItem label="YAML">` immediately followed by a fence). MDX renders that fine; the problem is that markdownlint parses CommonMark, where the tag opens an HTML block that runs to the next blank line — so the fence is not a code block to any generic rule, and `markdownlint --fix` will happily reformat the code inside it. The blank line is what keeps the two parsers agreeing.

Run `make fix` to apply them. **The generic markdownlint fixers run over `.md` only.** markdownlint parses CommonMark and MDX does not, and where the two disagree an autofix rewrites the inside of a code block — de-indenting YAML comments it reads as headings, autolinking bare URLs. Reporting that disagreement is useful, so `make lint` still checks `.mdx`; acting on it is not. MDX therefore gets exactly one *structural* fixer, `scripts/fix-mdx-fences.mjs`, which only ever inserts a blank line beside a JSX tag. (misspell still auto-corrects spelling in `.mdx` — its corrections come from a curated list and don't depend on parsing the document.)

The practical consequence: **a problem `make lint` reports in an `.mdx` file may need fixing by hand**, WH001's hard-wrapped prose included. A bare `markdownlint-cli2 --fix` can't reach MDX either: `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc` globs `.md` only and the `.mdx` glob sits on `lint:md`, so the guard is structural rather than a rule you have to remember. Improving this — a formatter that understands MDX rather than one that guesses — is tracked in [#499](https://github.com/Wave-RF/WaveHouse/issues/499).

The markdownlint extension reads `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`, `customRules` and all, so no editor setting is needed — but it only activates on Markdown, so in-editor squiggles cover WH001 in `.md` and never WH002 in `.mdx`. Agent-written files get the same treatment at write time from `.claude/hooks/markdown-on-save.sh` — markdownlint in `.md`, the fence pass in `.mdx` — and everyone else gets it from `make fix`.

## Code Conventions

- **Strict Go formatting**: Use `gofumpt` (a stricter superset of `gofmt`, enforced by CI). Run `make fmt` to format.
- **Interface-first design**: Core behaviors (`Cache`, `Deduplicator`, `Publisher`, `Subscriber`) are defined as interfaces so implementations can be swapped behind a stable contract.
- **Package boundaries**: The `internal/` directory ensures packages are private to this module.
- **Error handling**: Return errors to callers. Use `slog` for structured logging.
- **Schema-driven**: ClickHouse is the schema source of truth. WaveHouse discovers and validates against real table schemas.

## Makefile Targets

Run `make help` to see all targets. Key ones:

| Target | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `make help` | Show all targets with descriptions (always the source of truth) |
| `make tools` | Bootstrap: install pinned tools (`golangci-lint`, `air`, `misspell`, `shellcheck`, `actionlint`), Go modules, pnpm deps, and git hooks (`core.hooksPath` → `.githooks/`) |
| **Dev** | |
| `make dev` | Hot-reload dev server: ClickHouse via Compose + WaveHouse under air on `:8080` |
| `make deps-up` | Start ClickHouse alone (idempotent; blocks until healthy) |
| `make deps-down` | Stop ClickHouse (preserves data volume) |
| `make deps-logs` | Tail ClickHouse logs |
| `make deps-shell` | `clickhouse-client` REPL on the running container |
| `make deps-wipe` | Stop ClickHouse AND destroy its data volume (DESTRUCTIVE) |
| **Observability** | |
| `make obs-aspire` | Prebuilt 0-config o11y UI to show WaveHouse metrics, logs, and traces locally |
| `make obs-grafana` | Grafana alternative to aspire, more advanced and complicated |
| `make obs-front` | Custom graphs like grafana, but is simpler and easier to configure like aspire |
| **Static checks** | |
| `make fmt` | Check formatting across Go (`gofumpt`) + TS (Biome). Run `make fix` to apply. |
| `make tidy` | Verify `go.mod`/`go.sum` are tidy (run `make fix` to apply) |
| `make lint` | Run linters across Go (`golangci-lint`) + TS (Biome) + Markdown/MDX (markdownlint) + prose (misspell) |
| `make vulncheck` | Run `govulncheck` (V=1 for full call stacks) |
| `make verify` | Repo-wide static checks: Go (tidy + fmt + vulncheck + lint) + TS (Biome + `tsc` typecheck) + Markdown/MDX (markdownlint + rule fixtures) + prose (misspell) + shell (shellcheck) + workflows (actionlint) + path-classifier fixtures + release-channel fixtures + docs type-check (`astro check` — not a full build, so link validation stays CI's job) (parallel-safe: `make -j verify`) |
| `make fix` | Auto-fixes across Go (`tidy` + `gofumpt` + `goimports` + `lint --fix`), TS (Biome `--write`), Markdown (markdownlint `--fix`), MDX (`fix-mdx-fences` only — the generic fixers never run over `.mdx`), and docs-prose spelling (misspell, both) |
| **Build** | |
| `make build` | Compile `wavehouse` → `bin/wavehouse` (debug symbols kept) |
| `make build-release` | Stripped release-style build → `bin/wavehouse-release` |
| `make build-cover` | Coverage-instrumented build → `bin/wavehouse-cov` (used by E2E) |
| `make build-ts` | Build TypeScript SDK → `clients/ts/dist/` |
| **Test** | |
| `make test` | Alias for `test-unit` |
| `make test-unit` | Go unit tests + render coverage + gate suite threshold |
| `make test-integration` | Go integration tests (requires Docker) + coverage gate |
| `make test-ts` | SDK vitest unit tests + v8 coverage + gate against `suites.ts-unit` (matches Go's "always coverage" pattern) |
| `make cov` | Merge Go + TS coverage and gate against thresholds. Auto-runs after `make test-all` and `make ci`; standalone `make cov` is "show me the merged numbers without re-running." Each side skips silently if its data is missing, but `make cov` fails if *both* are empty (you ran it before any test target). |
| `make test-e2e` | E2E SDK suite against `bin/wavehouse-cov` + coverage gate |
| `make test-all` | All four suites sequentially + merged coverage gate |
| `make ci` | Full pipeline: parallel `verify` + builds + unit/SDK tests, then integration + E2E + cov |
| **Release** (see [Cutting a release](#cutting-a-release)) | |
| `make release-server VERSION=X.Y.Z` | Tag a server release — binaries + container image |
| `make release-sdk-ts VERSION=X.Y.Z` | Tag a TypeScript SDK release — npm |
| `make release-sdk-go VERSION=X.Y.Z` | Tag a Go SDK release — `go get` (pending [#434](https://github.com/Wave-RF/WaveHouse/pull/434)) |
| **Analysis** (informational, not in CI) | |
| `make size` | Binary size analysis → `tmp/analysis/` (text + SVG + interactive HTML) |
| `make audit-cgo` | Audit dependency tree for C files (builds use `CGO_ENABLED=0`) |
| `make deadcode` | Find unreachable functions |
| `make dep-cut` | Top cuttable deps by transitive weight (`LIMIT=N` to override) |
| `make binary-analysis` | Combined: `size` + `audit-cgo` + `deadcode` |
| **Cleanup** (tiered — compose explicitly for partial resets) | |
| `make clean` | Build outputs only (`bin/`, `dist/`, `clients/ts/dist/`, `docs/dist/`, `docs/.dev-dist/`) |
| `make clean-test` | Test outputs only (`tmp/` — coverage data, logs, NATS state) |
| `make clean-tools` | Installed tools and pnpm deps (`.bin/`, `node_modules/`) |
| `make clean-all` | Full reset: above + `data/` + Docker volumes |

All test targets accept `ARGS="..."` for pass-through `go test` flags. Build targets accept `TAGS="..."` for Go build tags. `V=1` switches to verbose `gotestsum` output.

## Dependency Management

### Updating Dependencies

```bash
go get -u ./...        # Update all direct deps to latest minor/patch
go mod tidy            # Remove unused, add missing
```

### Vulnerability Scanning

`govulncheck` analyzes your actual call graph — not just the module graph — so it only reports vulnerabilities in code paths you use.

```bash
make vulncheck
```

For a combined security scan, run `make verify` — it runs `vulncheck` alongside `lint`, and `gosec` is one of the linters enabled in `.golangci.yml`. This is also what CI runs on every push and pull request.

### Dependabot

Dependabot is configured in `.github/dependabot.yml` to open weekly grouped PRs for three update configs:

- **Go modules** (root) — outdated or vulnerable Go dependencies, commit prefix `deps:`
- **GitHub Actions** (root **and** `/.github/actions/setup-env`) — outdated action versions tracked against the SHA pins across `.github/workflows/*` and the `setup-env` composite action, commit prefix `ci:`
- **npm — pnpm workspace** (root) — covers all three TypeScript packages (the docs site, the SDK, and the E2E tests) in one grouped PR, commit prefix `deps:`

PRs are grouped per config to reduce noise. The npm config is pointed at the workspace **root** (`directory: /`), not the individual member directories. The repo has a single root `pnpm-lock.yaml`, and Dependabot only updates a lockfile co-located with the manifest it targets — so a per-member config (the previous setup) bumped a member's `package.json` without regenerating the root lockfile, and every such PR then failed CI's `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` with `ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE`. Pointing at the root lets Dependabot read `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, walk every member, and update the one lockfile.

The GitHub Actions config names **two** directories. `directory: /` reaches `.github/workflows/` but does not descend into `.github/actions/*/action.yml`, so the `setup-env` composite action — which owns every cache in `ci.yml` — was invisible to Dependabot, and its pins went stale against upstream and diverged from `publish-npm.yml`, which Dependabot *does* track and which doesn't call `setup-env`. Listing its directory under `directories:` brings it into the same weekly group; **adding a composite action means adding its directory there**, because nothing else catches the drift.

`typescript` majors are held back (`ignore: version-update:semver-major`) because `tsup` vendors a `rollup-plugin-dts` that crashes on TypeScript 7 during `clients/ts`'s `prepare` script — i.e. inside `pnpm install`, which takes every Node job down at once. See the comment in `.github/dependabot.yml` for the condition that lets it be removed.

**No auto-merge.** Dependabot PRs go through the same merge gate as any other PR — an approval from the `@Wave-RF/wavehouse-admins` team (the ruleset's `required_reviewers` rule) plus the required checks. (The former `dependabot-automerge.yml`, which auto-approved and merged patch/minor bumps hands-off, was removed — every bump now gets a human admin review.)

## Cutting a release

Cutting a release is **one tag** — no version bump in code, no release branch:

```bash
make release-server VERSION=0.1.0   # tag v0.1.0            → binaries + container image
make release-sdk-ts VERSION=0.1.0   # tag clients/ts/v0.1.0 → @wavehouse/sdk on npm
```

`make release-sdk-go` exists too, wired ahead of the Go SDK landing ([#434](https://github.com/Wave-RF/WaveHouse/pull/434)); it refuses to run until `clients/go/` is in the repo.

The one thing to do *before* tagging is promote the changelog: `AGENTS.md` requires every PR to add its entry under `## Unreleased`, so open a PR renaming that heading to `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` and adding the matching link reference at the foot of the file. Nothing in the release pipeline reads `CHANGELOG.md` — this is for the file's own readers.

Each runs [`scripts/release.sh`](https://github.com/Wave-RF/WaveHouse/blob/main/scripts/release.sh), which preflights (on `main`, clean tree, in sync with `origin/main`, the tag free both locally and on the remote, the required `CI` check green on *this exact commit*), prints exactly what will be published, and asks before pushing. `DRY_RUN=1 make release-…` stops after the plan. Tag creation is admin-only via the `release tag protection` ruleset.

The components are independent — releasing the server does not publish the SDK, and their version numbers need not match.

### Why there is no version to bump

The **tag is the version**, everywhere:

| Component | Where the version comes from |
| --- | --- |
| Server | GoReleaser's `-ldflags` at build time, from the tag |
| Go SDK | The tag itself — a Go module has no version file |
| TypeScript SDK | `publish-npm.yml` stamps `clients/ts/package.json` from the tag before publishing |

The npm case is the one that usually forces a bump commit, and it is deliberately not the source of truth here: the `main` ruleset forbids pushing to `main` directly, so bumping `package.json` would mean a reviewed PR merged before *every* release. The committed value is documentation — if it drifts from the tag, the workflow logs a notice and the tag wins.

### Tag naming

```text
v0.1.0              server (root Go module)
clients/ts/v0.1.0   @wavehouse/sdk
clients/go/v0.1.0   Go SDK
```

The `clients/<lang>/` prefix isn't a style choice. Go resolves a module in a subdirectory only against a tag carrying that subdirectory as a prefix ([the module reference](https://go.dev/ref/mod) is explicit), so `go get github.com/Wave-RF/WaveHouse/clients/go@v0.1.0` requires precisely `clients/go/v0.1.0`. Every client follows that shape rather than leaving Go as the exception, and a new language is one more `clients/<lang>/v*` family.

Tag globs are anchored at the start of the ref name, so `v*` never matches a `clients/...` tag — which is what keeps a client release from triggering a server release.

### What a release publishes

- **Server —** a **GitHub Release** with the cross-compiled archives (linux/darwin/windows/freebsd × amd64/arm64; `.zip` on Windows, `.tar.gz` elsewhere) and `checksums.txt`. A tag carrying a prerelease suffix (`v0.1.0-alpha.1`) is marked as a GitHub pre-release, so it never takes the "Latest release" badge from a shipped stable version.
- **Both —** **release notes generated by GitHub** from the PRs merged since the previous tag *in the same family* — one line per PR, since `main` is squash-merged, grouped into the categories defined in [`.github/release.yml`](https://github.com/Wave-RF/WaveHouse/blob/main/.github/release.yml). Grouping is by **PR label**: `github_actions` / `documentation` are applied automatically by `actions/labeler`, but `breaking-change`, `security`, `bug`, and `enhancement` are applied by hand — an unlabelled PR lands in "Other changes". Dependabot is split out by **author** rather than by label, because the labels `actions/labeler` applies by path — `github_actions`, `documentation` — mark our own PRs too; our CI work gets its own "CI & build" section — ordered above Documentation, since a CI PR here nearly always updates docs too — and Dependencies is pure Dependabot residue. **Any category keyed on a label a Dependabot PR can carry needs that author exclude** — labeler's path labels *and* the ecosystem labels Dependabot applies itself (`dependencies`, `javascript`, `go`, `github_actions`; `javascript` is in neither `labeler.yml` nor our categories) — or that category intercepts bumps before they reach the `📦 Dependencies` catch-all. `CHANGELOG.md` is *not* the source of the release body; it is the longer-form record of why each change was made.
- **Server —** a **GHCR image** at `ghcr.io/wave-rf/wavehouse`, with two tags: the immutable `:vX.Y.Z`, and one moving *channel* pointer. A stable release moves `:latest`; a prerelease moves `:alpha` / `:beta` / `:rc` / `:next` instead, matching the npm dist-tag it would get. The channel comes from the **first** prerelease identifier, matched **exactly**: `v0.2.0-rc.1` → `:rc`, while `-alpha1`, `-preview.1`, or any other form → `:next`. `scripts/ci/release-channel.sh` is the single rule every publisher uses, so `ghcr.io/wave-rf/wavehouse:rc` and `@wavehouse/sdk@rc` can't drift apart. **A prerelease-only project therefore has no `:latest` tag** — that is deliberate; `:latest` starts existing when the first stable release ships.
- **TypeScript SDK —** an **npm publish** of `@wavehouse/sdk` under `latest` (stable) or `alpha`/`beta`/`rc`/`next` (prerelease), plus its own GitHub Release.
- **Server —** **build-provenance attestations** (Sigstore, free for public repos) over every archive and over the image's multi-arch manifest digest; the image attestation is stored alongside the image in GHCR. The release job verifies its own attestations before finishing, so a release that publishes unverifiable provenance goes red.
- **TypeScript SDK —** an **npm provenance attestation** via `npm publish --provenance`, surfaced as the provenance badge on the package page and checkable with `npm audit signatures`. The npm job does not re-verify it the way the server job does.

Binaries installed with `go install github.com/Wave-RF/WaveHouse/cmd/wavehouse@vX.Y.Z` get no `-ldflags`, so they read their version from the module metadata the Go toolchain embeds; `/version` reports the tag without its leading `v` (`0.1.0`, not `v0.1.0`), with `git_commit`/`build_time` as `unknown`. Release archives and container images carry all three.

Consumers can check provenance for themselves:

```bash
gh attestation verify wavehouse_linux_amd64.tar.gz \
  --repo Wave-RF/WaveHouse \
  --signer-workflow Wave-RF/WaveHouse/.github/workflows/release.yml

gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/wave-rf/wavehouse:v0.1.0 \
  --repo Wave-RF/WaveHouse \
  --signer-workflow Wave-RF/WaveHouse/.github/workflows/release.yml
```

`--signer-workflow` is not optional garnish: `--repo` alone accepts an attestation produced by *any* workflow in the repo. Same point, and the `:dev` equivalent, in [Deployment → Registry](/deployment#registry) and `SECURITY.md`.

:::note[Releasing from the GitHub UI instead]
Publishing a release from **Releases → Draft a new release** creates the tag, which fires the same workflow — so it works, and GoReleaser's default `mode: keep-existing` (the key is not set in `.goreleaser.yaml`) means it will not overwrite notes you wrote. Two things the `make` targets do for you and the UI does not: none of the preflight checks run, and you must click **Generate release notes** yourself, because a body you publish empty stays empty.
:::

## The `dev` channel

Between releases, every push to `main` republishes both artifacts so `@dev` always means "current `main`":

- **`ghcr.io/wave-rf/wavehouse:dev`** — a rolling pointer, plus an immutable `:dev-<sha>` (pruned after 30 days by `cleanup-ghcr.yml`, newest 5 always kept). Built by the same GoReleaser pipeline with `WAVEHOUSE_DEV=1`, which suppresses the GitHub Release. Note a Docker tag is only a pointer: `docker run …:dev` reuses a stale local image unless you `docker pull` first or pass `--pull=always`.
- **`@wavehouse/sdk@dev`** — `0.0.1-dev.<utc-stamp>.h<build-hash>`, published only when the published package actually changes. The trailing hash covers every file `npm pack` would ship — the built `dist/`, `package.json` minus its `version`, and the bundled `README`/`LICENSE` — so a push whose package would be byte-identical to the current `dev` publish is skipped, while a change to `exports`, `files`, `bin`, or `engines` republishes even though `dist/` is untouched.

  The `<utc-stamp>` is load-bearing, not decoration. `npm install …@dev` records a *range* in your `package.json`, not the dist-tag, so what you get on the next install is the highest version matching that range. Under the old `0.0.0-dev.h<hash>` scheme, semver's lexical ordering of alphanumeric prerelease identifiers meant the newest publish routinely wasn't the highest one, and a range could resolve *backwards* — an `@dev` install landed on a two-month-old build ([#475](https://github.com/Wave-RF/WaveHouse/issues/475)). A numeric identifier compares numerically, so the channel now orders by publish time. The `0.0.1` base keeps the channel below every real release (so a dev build can never satisfy `^0.1.0`) and above the legacy `0.0.0-dev.*` publishes, which npm's 72-hour unpublish window makes permanent.

:::caution[`latest` still points at a dev snapshot]
npm set this package's `latest` dist-tag on its *first* publish — even though that publish went out under `--tag dev` — so it currently resolves to `0.0.0-dev.0f8826c`, the June 4 bootstrap build. Until the first **stable** `clients/ts/v*` release, a bare `npm install @wavehouse/sdk` and the bare CDN URLs get that snapshot, **not** a release — a prerelease publishes under `alpha`/`beta`/`rc`/`next` and leaves `latest` where it is. Publishing the first stable version moves `latest` to it and fixes this for every consumer; delete this note in the same change.

Docker needs no equivalent fix: a tag is a mutable pointer resolved fresh on every pull, with no version ranges and no ordering, so the failure mode #475 describes cannot arise there.

## CI & review automation

AI automation sits alongside the normal CI checks — advisory PR review from CodeRabbit and Copilot, plus the local Claude Code tooling in `.claude/`. Full detail lives in `AGENTS.md` §Repository Automation; this section covers the contributor-facing behavior.

### PR title and Conventional Commits

PR titles must match Conventional Commits format and stay ≤ 72 characters — the title becomes the squash-merge commit subject. Both rules are enforced by the `PR title` job under the required `CI` check (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`); validate locally with `scripts/lint-pr-title.sh "<title>"`:

```text
<type>(optional-scope)(optional-!): <lowercase subject, no trailing period>
```

Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`, `deps`, `build`, `perf`, `revert`, `style`.

The `!` before `:` marks a breaking change per Conventional Commits 1.0.0 (e.g., `feat!: remove deprecated endpoint`, `refactor(api)!: rename handlers`). Titles are also capped at **72 characters** — they become squash-merge commit subjects (Dependabot PRs are exempt from the cap).

If the title doesn't match, a sticky comment posts on the PR explaining the format (from the `PR housekeeping` workflow, which mirrors the same script); it auto-removes once the title is fixed. Fixing the title needs no new push — the edit triggers housekeeping, which re-runs the failed `PR title` job (the job re-reads the title from the API, not the stale event payload).

### Required status checks

The `main branch protection` ruleset requires one status check to pass before any PR can merge:

- `CI` — the aggregator job of `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. The workflow is a job DAG over the same Makefile targets local `make ci` runs: `lint` (`make verify`), `unit` (`make test-unit test-ts`), `integration` (`make test-integration`), `e2e` (`make -j test-e2e` — builds its own SDK dist + cover binary on a warm cache, runs the suite exactly like a local run), `coverage` (`make cov` over every suite's uploaded coverage fragment + threshold gates, like local `make ci`'s final step), `docs-build` (`make build-docs` when docs-affecting files changed, uploading the docs dist artifact), `PR title` (Conventional Commits), and the docs preview/deploy jobs. The aggregator fails if any job failed or was canceled and treats skipped jobs as passing — docs-only PRs skip the Go test suites by design, and fork PRs run everything except the (secret-bearing) docs deploys. Every run's Summary page gets a per-job wall-clock table from the non-gating `Timing summary` job. The full architecture — DAG diagram, design invariants, cache policy, how to add a job — lives in [`.github/workflows/README.md`](https://github.com/Wave-RF/WaveHouse/blob/main/.github/workflows/README.md).

The `PR housekeeping` workflow still runs on every PR (labels + the title explainer comment) but is no longer a required check.

The ruleset also requires an approval from the `@Wave-RF/wavehouse-admins` team (the `required_reviewers` rule — this is what mandates an admin sign-off, replacing the old `Admin approval` status-check workflow), plus 1 approving review, approval of the most recent push by someone other than its author, resolution of all review threads, linear history, no branch deletion, no force-push, and squash-merge only. Repository admins may bypass these requirements when merging their own PR (e.g. a trivial `.github` change) but still cannot push directly to `main`.

Approved, green PRs land through a **merge queue** ("Merge when ready"): the queue re-runs the required `CI` check against the PR merged with *current* main (a `merge_group` event — the CI workflow runs the full test suite for these) and fast-forwards only on green. That integration re-test replaces the old "branch is out-of-date with the base branch" requirement — queued PRs don't need manual branch updates, and the queue never pushes to the PR branch.

Dependabot PRs go through the same admin review as any other PR — there is no auto-merge (see the Dependabot section above).

### Merge behavior

Squash-only merges. The **PR title** becomes the commit subject (with `(#NN)` appended automatically), the **PR body** becomes the commit message. Keep PR bodies tight — they land in `git log` on `main`. The PR template gives the right shape (Summary / Test plan / Related Issues).

Include `Closes #NN` in the PR body to auto-close the related issue on merge. Alternatively, link the issue in the sidebar's **Development** section — that triggers auto-close even without the keyword.

Auto-merge is enabled repo-wide: click "Enable auto-merge (squash)" on a PR and it merges once checks + approvals land.

### AI reviewers

Advisory PR review comes from marketplace apps configured at the org/repo level:

- **CodeRabbit** — automated PR review; auto-reviews on open + push, re-trigger with `@coderabbitai review`.
- **Copilot** — tied to individual reviewer subscriptions; shows up on PRs where a maintainer with Copilot Pro is listed as a reviewer.

Both are **advisory** — the ruleset's `required_reviewers` rule (an `@Wave-RF/wavehouse-admins` approval) plus its thread-resolution / linear-history / required-check rules are the actual merge-gate.

### Reviewer assignment and the Task Board

Reviewer assignment is GitHub-native, and so is the board:

- **Reviewer assignment**: the `main branch protection` ruleset's `required_reviewers` rule requests the `@Wave-RF/wavehouse-admins` team on every PR, and the team's **code-review assignment** (configured on the team) auto-assigns and load-balances a specific member. No workflow is involved; `dismiss_stale_reviews_on_push` clears approvals on new commits, and GitHub re-requests per its own rules.
- **Merge gate**: the ruleset's `required_reviewers` rule requires an `APPROVED` review from the `@Wave-RF/wavehouse-admins` team; it also adds review-thread resolution, linear history, and squash-only. Auto-merge (squash) takes over once checks and approvals land.
- **Task Board** (Projects v2, project #7): card placement and status are handled by GitHub-native Projects v2 automation configured in the project UI — there is no workflow-driven board state machine. Priority lives on the board's `Priority` field (set during issue triage, below).

Dependabot PRs go through the same admin review as any other PR — there is no auto-merge (see the Dependabot section above).

### Invoking bots manually

- **CodeRabbit**: comment `@coderabbitai review` to re-trigger a review, or `@coderabbitai <question>` to ask it something. Works in both top-level and inline review comments.
- **Copilot**: the re-request-review button on the PR page sends a fresh request.

### Review-response expectations

Every review comment (human or AI) must get a substantive reply before merge — not "fixed" alone. The ruleset's `required_review_thread_resolution: true` means unresolved conversations literally block merge. Agents working on PRs follow the pattern documented in `AGENTS.md` §"Review Response": accept / push back / defer, reply with detail, resolve when settled.

When pushing back on a bot's suggestion, end the reply with the bot's mention (e.g. `@coderabbitai`) to invite a counter-reply so the dialog actually loops.

### Issue triage

Issue triage is **manual**. There is no triage workflow: `.github/workflows/triage.yml` classified new and edited issues with GitHub Models, which GitHub [retired on 2026-07-30](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-07-30-github-models-is-now-retired/) — the inference endpoint returns `410` for every request, so the workflow failed on every issue open/edit until it was removed ([#431](https://github.com/Wave-RF/WaveHouse/issues/431)).

What that means in practice:

- `area/*`, `security`, and `breaking-change` labels are applied by hand when an issue is triaged. PR labels are unaffected — those come from `actions/labeler` (below), which is path-based and needs no model.
- Priority on the **Task Board** project #7 is set by hand on the board's `Priority` field. `.github/board-config.env` existed only for that workflow and is gone with it. The `PROJECT_BOARD_TOKEN` repo secret is now **unused** — it has no consumers left, so it is worth deleting and revoking the PAT behind it.
- Maintainers running Claude Code can use the `/pm-triage` skill, which does the same classification locally against the live board.

### Auto-labeling PRs

The `PR housekeeping` workflow (`.github/workflows/housekeeping.yml`) runs `actions/labeler` with `.github/labeler.yml` to apply `area/*`, `dependencies`, `github_actions`, `go`, and `documentation` labels to PRs based on the files they change. Sync-mode: labels follow the current changed-file set.

### When adding a new `internal/<pkg>/` package

Follow the checklist in `AGENTS.md` §"Common Tasks / Adding a new internal package" — the automation-relevant steps are:

1. Create a matching `area/<pkg>` repo label with a meaningful description.
2. Add the path → label mapping to `.github/labeler.yml` so PRs touching the new package get auto-labeled.

Step 2 is the one that automates anything — PR labeling is path-based. Step 1's label is applied by hand during issue triage.

## Fork cache validation

The `boringcache-validation` branch has an optional Go cache comparison.
See [the validation procedure](https://github.com/boringcache/WaveHouse/blob/boringcache-validation/.github/boringcache-validation.md) for
the measured cases, source sequence, authentication, and evidence limits.
