 *

 * the compiler `data` is present), while `error` is always available for
 * debugging on failure. `data`/`error` remain populated as before.

/**
 * A `fetch`-compatible function.
 *
 * Spelled out rather than written `typeof fetch`, which resolves differently
 * depending on whether the consumer's TypeScript `lib` includes DOM — the same
 * signature either way, but stable across configurations.
 *
 * The parameter is `string` rather than `typeof fetch`'s wider union because a
 * string URL is all the SDK ever passes. Since parameters are contravariant,
 * narrowing it *widens* what can be assigned: the global `fetch` still fits, and
 * so does hand-written `(url: string, init?: RequestInit) => Promise<Response>`
 * middleware, which the wider spelling rejects at compile time.
 *
 * On REST the SDK reads `.ok` and `.headers` always, `.text()` on success, and
 * `.status`, `.statusText` plus `.json()` when the response is not `ok`. A
 * rejection becomes a `NETWORK_ERROR` result and is retried with backoff —
 * unless the `AbortSignal` you passed has been aborted, in which case the
 * result is `ABORTED` and nothing is retried. That is decided from the signal
 * rather than the rejection's type, so an implementation that throws something
 * other than a `DOMException` named `AbortError` — `AbortSignal.timeout()`,
 * `node-fetch` — is reported the same way.
 *
 * **Streaming needs more.** `.stream()` and `.liveQuery()` read the response as
 * it arrives, via `.body.getReader()`, so an implementation used with them must
 * return a response carrying a live `ReadableStream` — something the type cannot
 * enforce, since `Response.body` is legitimately nullable. A response handed
 * back with an absent or already-consumed body fails fast with
 * `SSE_NO_STREAM_BODY`. What the SDK *cannot* rescue is an implementation that
 * awaits the body before returning — `await res.text()`, or the
 * `res.clone().text()` a logging wrapper reaches for — because on a stream that
 * never ends, that never resolves and your function never returns. Both satisfy
 * every REST call, which is what makes the trap easy to walk into.
 *
 * Implementations shipping their own request/response declarations (undici,
 * `node-fetch`) need casts on the init and the return value, since those types
 * are separate from the ones behind your global `fetch`; the narrow runtime
 * contract above is what makes them safe.

   *       undiciFetch(url, { ...init, dispatcher } as never) as unknown as Promise<Response>,
   *   },
   * });
   * ```

   * SDK's own headers: `auth` still owns `Authorization`, and the
   * `Content-Type` and `Accept` a given request needs are not overridable
   * here — a global `Content-Type` that outranked the request's own is a
   * documented way to break uploads.
   *
   * In a browser these are subject to CORS: a header outside the safelist adds
   * it to the preflight, which the origin must allow. WaveHouse's own CORS
   * advertises a fixed set, so custom headers reach it cross-origin only when
   * a proxy in front terminates the preflight — which is the deployment they
   * exist for. Server-side callers never preflight.

   * Extra `RequestInit` fields merged into every request — `credentials` for a
   * cookie-authenticated origin, `mode`, `cache`, `keepalive`, or a
   * runtime-specific extension such as Next.js's `next: { tags }`.
   *
   * Fields the SDK controls (`method`, `headers`, `body`, `signal`) always
   * win, so this cannot corrupt the request itself. Non-standard fields may
   * need a cast, since `RequestInit` only declares the standard ones.
   *
   * The streaming transport additionally owns `cache` and `redirect`, where the
   * values are load-bearing rather than preference: a `Cache-Control` header
   * would fail cross-origin preflight, and following a redirect would strip the
   * `Authorization` header on a cross-origin hop and silently downgrade the
   * stream to the default role instead of failing. So a request carrying an
   * `auth` token, or configured `headers` that may hold a proxy secret, refuses
   * redirects (`SSE_REDIRECT`); without either it follows them, so CDN
   * canonicalization and an http→https upgrade still work. Note the test is
   * that concrete pair, not "is this authenticated" — **cookies are invisible
   * to it**. A cookie is re-derived from the cookie store at each hop rather
   * than carried, so under the default `same-origin` credentials mode a
   * redirect keeps the stream authenticated only while the hop stays inside
   * both the request's origin and the cookie's `Path`; a hop outside either
   * arrives with no cookie and gets a `default_role` view rather than an error.
   * With `credentials: "include"` the origin half is replaced rather than
   * lifted: ordinary cookie scoping decides, so the cookie crosses a
   * CORS-allowed cross-origin hop only if its own `Domain` covers the target —
   * a host-only cookie, the default, still stops at its host. Spelled out
   * under "Supplying your own `fetch`" in the SDK guide; see #478.
   * `credentials` itself is honored in browsers and dropped elsewhere, since
   * some runtimes throw if it is set.
